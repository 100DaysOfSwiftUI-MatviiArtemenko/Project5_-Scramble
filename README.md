> *This project was a last chance to review the fundamentals of SwiftUI before we move on to greater things with the next app. Still, we managed to cover some useful new things, not least `List`, `onAppear`, `Bundle`, `fatalError()`, `UITextChecker`, and more, and you have another app you can extend if you want to.*

## &nbsp; 📚 Covered topics

  List, Bundle, UITextChecker, onAppear, fatalError()

## &nbsp; 🎖 Challenge
* [x] Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.

* [x] Add a toolbar button that calls `startGame()`, so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.

* [x] Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player’s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
